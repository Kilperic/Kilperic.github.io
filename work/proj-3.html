<p>This project is presenting a version of my curriculum vitae with some visual enhancements.</p>
<p>The point here was not to use infographics just for aesthetics.</p>
<p>For each element I wanted to find  the most attractive, suitable and readable way to display it, so that we can focus on the information itself.</p><br>
